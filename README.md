Pipes(AddonXPConverter)
This plugin is a development from Pipes(by def9a2a4 - github)

The original code Pipes: https://github.com/def9a2a4/Pipes/tree/main

This plugin as its name, add xp converter(the original plugin can not transfer the xp orbs, because they are not items)

How it works? It will add converter, which convert the xp orbs to Bottle o' enchanting, and give bonus Bottle o' enchanting(random 0 to 3 by chance, just for fun ^^)

Turn on or off convert the xp orbs to Bottle o' enchanting by using command:

/pipes enable_xp_bottle

Get the state of converter by using command:

/pipes get_isenable_xp_bottle

Work in 1.21
